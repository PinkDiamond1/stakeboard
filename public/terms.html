          <h2 class="sectionHeading">What the KILT Stakeboard is</h2>

          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard allows you to manage your staking on the KILT 
            Blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, you can</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              see how many stakeable KILT Coins you have in each of your 
              identities or addresses
            </li>
            <li>
              display how many you have staked with each of your identities 
              or addresses
            </li>
            <li>
              display which collator you back, with which identity or address
            </li>
            <li>
              display how many KILT Coins you can still stake
            </li>
            <li>
              prepare a transaction to stake or to increase or decrease your 
              staking amount 
            </li>
            <li>
              have the transaction you would need for your changed staking 
              amount calculated
            </li>
            <li>
              transfer this prepared transaction to your wallet for signature 
              to be processed by the KILT Blockchain.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Also, the KILT Stakeboard reads from the KILT blockchain or 
            third-party applications and shows you
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the stakes for each collator
            </li>
            <li>
              stake of respective collator + delegators staked on them
            </li>
            <li>
              ranking of the collators
            </li>
            <li>
              which collator is/isn’t actively creating blocks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The data generated in and for your staking activities is 
            stored locally on your device. The balances displayed are 
            based on the information currently stored on the KILT blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the KILT Stakeboard is made through your wallet and all 
            transactions prepared in the KILT Stakeboard will need to be signed
            via the wallet through which the KILT Coins are accessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any rewards received for your staking will automatically go 
            to the same identity or address where your stake comes from.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="sectionHeading">NOTE: Professional crypto staker</h2>

          <p>
            The KILT Stakeboard is aimed exclusively at professional crypto 
            stakers (entrepreneurs in the sense of § 14 BGB/ German Civil Code)
            who have familiarised themselves sufficiently with staking and the
            resulting rewards, as well as the prerequisites and calculation of 
            these rewards in the KILT ecosystem, so that they fully understand 
            the impact their actions on the KILT Stakeboard can have.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the KILT Stakeboard, you declare that you are a 
            professional crypto staker, i.e. to act as entrepreneur and not in
            your capacity as a Consumer. Entrepreneur is any natural person or
            legal entity who, when using the KILT Stakeboard, acts in exercise
            of its commercial or self-employed professional activity.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sectionHeading">Staking, Investment, Legal or Tax Advice</h2>

          <p>
            Nothing published by the B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH should be
            interpreted as staking or investment advice. B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity
            GmbH is in no way providing trading, staking or investment advice. Please
            consult with your appropriate licensed professional before making any
            financial transactions, including any investments related to ideas or opinions
            expressed, past, present, or future by the aforementioned entity and any
            existing or future entities that may operate under the parent entities. B.T.E.
            BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH does not intend to express financial, legal, tax,
            or any other advice and any conclusions drawn from statements made by, or on,
            B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH shall not be deemed to constitute advice in
            any jurisdiction. Information is provided for practical, educational and
            amusement purposes only.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="sectionHeading">Liability</h2>
          
          <p>
            B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "BTE") is
            liable for damages that are based on an intentional or grossly negligent
            breach of duty by BTE, its legal representatives or various agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, BTE shall only be
            liable for the contractually typical, foreseeable damage if this was simply
            cause by negligence. Significant contractual obligations are those whose
            fulfilment enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and
            whose compliance you can regularly rely on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the legal
            representatives and various agents of BTE, if claims are asserted directly
            against them. The liability limitations resulting from the two preceding
            paragraphs do not apply insofar as BTE fraudulently concealed the defect or
            assumed a guarantee for the quality of KILT Stakeboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liability for culpable injury to life, limb and health and liability under
            Product Liability Act remain unaffected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any additional claims for damages are excluded.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="sectionHeading">Risk information</h2>
          
          <p>
            The following risk information contains a list of risks associated with the
            use of KILT Stakeboard. The list is not exhaustive. It is not excluded that
            further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard is used on your system as a web application and to prepare
            transactions to be signed with your wallet. For the security of your wallet,
            it is essential that your system is not compromised with malware. Please make
            sure that this is the case, because malware running unnoticed in the
            background, for example a key tracker, represents a major security risk for
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard communicates with the KILT Blockchain and depends on its
            functionality. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of KILT
            Blockchain or the technical ecosystem in which it lives may adversely affect
            the KILT Stakeboard or the information available there.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard and in particular the underlying software application may be
            the subject of hacking or other malicious interference by unauthorised third
            parties resulting in the loss, theft or other violation of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you want to use the KILT Stakeboard in the version tested and finalised
            by us, always make sure to use it via stakeboard.kilt.io. Otherwise, there is
            a risk that a third party may unconsciously or knowingly incorporate errors
            leading to potential adverse consequences for the usability and functionality
            of their copy or amended version of the KILT Stakeboard not controlled by us
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be absolutely sure that the transaction is correct and reflects what you
            wanted, always check the information and data in your wallet before signing
            the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication via internet-based systems is fundamentally susceptible to
            data/information being read and possibly even changed. We have no influence on
            which processes (now and in the future) run in the background of the web
            browser used.
